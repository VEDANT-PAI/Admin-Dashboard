**Mosaic Lite** is a responsive admin dashboard template built on top of Tailwind CSS and fully coded in React. It comes with several pre-coded charts (built with Chart.js 3) and widgets, and it's a great starting point for anyone who wants to create a user interface for SaaS products, administrator dashboards, modern web apps, and more.

**UPDATE 2025-02-02**: Added Tailwind v4 support!

Use it for whatever you want.
